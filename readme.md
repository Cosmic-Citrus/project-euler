# Repo:    project-euler

This is code to solve problems given by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Description

Project Euler is a compilation of math problems, most of which are intended to be solved by a computer program. These math problems are designed to be challenging; aside from keen insight, one is expected to implement a clever algorithm that is optimized for efficiency. 

Problem 949 - posted on June 7, 2025 - is the [most recent problem]([Recent Problems - Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/recent)]) added to the [Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives). I have solved a handful of these, and intend to solve more in the future.
