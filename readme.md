# Repo:    project-euler

The purpose of this code is to solve problems given by [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Description

Project Euler is a compilation of math problems, most of which are intended to be solved by a computer program. These math problems are designed to become more difficult as one progresses through them, and one can test multiple algorithms to improve algorithmic efficiency.

Problem 949 - posted on June 7, 2025 - is the [most recent problem](https://projecteuler.net/recent) added to the [Project Euler Archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) as of June 9, 2025. I have solved a handful of these problems and intend to solve more in the future.
